# Assembe - vue.js template

> This is basic vue.js app build for use of Assembe API.

## Acquiring API

1. Go to [assembe.com](https://assembe.com) and register new account.
2. Go to [assembe.com/home#settings](https://assembe.com/home#settings), under App address you will find your API address.
3. Copy that domain and put to `config/assembe.js` under `apiHost` property.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
